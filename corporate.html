<h3 class="mt-4 Titlesegment">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h3>
<h3 class="mt-4"> </h3>

<h3 class="subtitle">What is your brand about:</h3>
<p>SELV is a brand that aims to make women feel confident in their abilities to take on leadership responsibilities in their lives. This may occur in a variety of settings, including the workplace, personal life, hobbies, and more. Society still views women as weak leaders since their vulnerability is perceived as a weakness rather than a strength. We encourage women to reject this viewpoint and not become submissive or even give up their dreams. That's why we, at SELV, believe that women may be proud of their vulnerability and perceive it as a strength. We think that through utilizing SELV's products, people will be able to 'SHOW THEIR SELV' to the rest of the world.</p>
		
<h3 class="subtitle">What channels/platforms are used and why:</h3>
<p>SELV has chosen to focus on two social media channels to promote our business. Because our brand is about overall female leadership, LinkedIn was the first social media channel we selected to promote it on. LinkedIn is a professional networking platform that efficiently connects individuals on a worldwide business level. We picked this platform because SELV wanted to focus their content on building a network for women to interact with and help them feel empowered. Furthermore, we thought LinkedIn was an excellent fit for our marketing approach, as we primarily focus on providing opportunities for women's professional advancement. However, during the execution of the marketing campaign we realised our perception was wrong, and in a paragraph below we will elaborate on this.</p>
	<p>The second social media platform on which we have promoted SELV is Instagram. As Instagram’s target group consists out of basically all internet users, we believed this would be ideal platform to promote our brand as we can reach both the younger and older audiences on there. We researched that Instagram has more than a billion registered users and almost all major companies use the platform to promote their brand on. Therefore, we thought Instagram would be ideal platform to promote SELV on. Instagram also has features that would be very useful for us, like commenting, direct messaging and stories. We thought with this features we could reach our target audience.</p>

<h3 class="subtitle">How does the campaign link to your objectives: </h3>
	<p>With our objectives, we <em>wanted</em> to achieve that women feel empowered to be the leaders they dream to be, that they feel inspired by our motivating messages and to feel united as a community of women who have a voice that should be heard in a masculine world. We tried to do this in our campaign by for example talking to the females in every post, posting convincing quotes, so that they could recognise, share it with their fellow females to create this uniting community.</p>
	<p>Another objective was that we wanted the target audience to response to our posts and stories by liking, sharing and/or commenting on our social media channels. With our marketing campaign, we based our posts on this objective as well and tried to reach the target audience by triggering a response of commenting on the posts and sharing them. Additionally, we wanted the target audience to visit our website through referrals on our social media channels. We tried to achieve this by referring to our website or end the captions on the posts with for example: “Do you share these thoughts? Visit our page and share this post with your fellow female bosses” or “Get Yours Soon”.</p>
		
<h3 class="subtitle">What did you do in terms of promotional activities: </h3>
	<p>To reach our objectives with our campaign, we used promotional activities such as reels, questions, facts, inspirational quotes and pictures. We believed that especially reels with, for example, a popular sound would reach a lot of people. Moreover, by asking questions or throwing facts, we thought this would be a call to action, make the audience think straight away and respond the answer in the comments of the posts.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 Titlesegment">Learning Points</h3>
	  <h3 class="mt-4"> </h3>
<h3 class="subtitle">Did we reach objectives?</h3>
	 <h3 class="mt-4"> </h3>
	<h5 class="Objective titleobjective">Reach Objective:</h5>
		<h5><em class="Objective">By the end of April 10th, 2022 we want to have reached 2500 people in total on our chosen social media platforms.</em></h5>
	  		<p>Overall, yes, we did reach our reach objective since we have reached 4.848 accounts on Instagram only. See proof Instagram. However looking at our reach on LinkedIn we have reached around 200 accounts. We could not see the same overview for instagram about the total reach. However we could see the reach per post. This varied from 45 views until 117 views  on one post. See proof LinkedIn. Therefore we assumed, as it is possible for one account to have seen multiple posts, that our overall reach on LinkedIn will be around 200 accounts. For this reason we are satisfied with the number of accounts we have reached but feel it could have been better given our inability to achieve a high reach on LinkedIn.</p>
	  	<h5 class="Objective">Proof LinkedIn</h5>
	       <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-start align-items-start">

      </ul>

	<h5 class="Objective titleobjective">Affect Objective:</h5>
		<h5><em class="Objective">By the end of April 10th, 2022 we want to see that our target audience feels empowered, united and inspired by our content. </em></h5>
	  		<p>In general, we achieved the effect objective since we have empowered, united and inspired the audience. But we do feel like this could have gone more successfully. The posts where we definitely empowered, united and inspired the audience is with the president reel. In which we asked the question what someone would do if they were president for one day. With this reel we achieved 60 likes and 4119 plays. Yet we are not completely satisfied since we have also had posts where we had almost no engagement with our target audience and on which we have received very few comments and/or shares.  From all comments we received almost all were so called ‘bots’ asking to send the photo to an other account for them to share in return for money. The other comments were engaging comments as you can see in the Proof Instagram, But those were only 4 comments. On linkedIn we did not fully reach the affect objective since we have a minimum reach already explained in the reach objective. However we did have 1 share and 16 reactions in the form of likes. So therefore we are not unsatisfied. See proof LinkedIn. </p>

		<h5><em class="Objective">By the end of April 10th, 2022 we want the target audience to respond to our posts and stories by liking, sharing and/or commenting on our social media channels.</em></h5>
	  		<p>This response objective is reached since we did have likes, shares and comments on our posts. However, we felt like this objective was more easy to achieve than we have actually done. We came to the conclusion that reaching accounts was quite possible, mostly on instagram. But actually getting a like comment or share was more difficult. On instagram we have gained a total of 111 likes and 33 comments. See proof Instagram.&nbsp; However from these comments only 4 were really from accounts that have been engaged by our content. The other comments were from ‘bots’ referring us to other accounts. On linkedIn we have reached a total of 16 reactions in the form of likes and 1 share. See proof LinkedIn. Therefore we did get likes comments and shares but we do feel this could have gone more successful. </p>

	  <h5><em class="Objective">By the end of April 10th, 2022 we want the target audience to follow our accounts on the social media platforms</em></h5>
	  		<p>We did reach this objective on Instagram but not for LinkedIn. On Instagram we gained a following of 93 accounts. And we are very satisfied with this. However on linkedIn we only gained a following of 6. We came to the conclusion that it is quite hard to get a following on LinkedIn as a startup business.</p>

	  <h3 class="subtitle">Things we expected</h3>
<p>What we expected in advance about the marketing of the brand SELV is that it was probably going to be harder to generate a lot of engagement on posts in terms of comments and likes. We assumed beforehand that our posts would probably get better views than the interaction we would get in return. We also expected that it would probably be difficult to create a large following. Still, we are very proud that we managed to reach a following of 93 accounts on instagram. We had also been given the tip beforehand to work with reels on instagram because you can reach accounts faster with them. Therefore we also expected that we would reach the majority of our accounts with this. We did however not expect that with 1 reel we would achieve all our reach objective. Lastly we expected that it would be beneficial for us to make a content calendar in the beginning of the project. To schedule out social media posts in advance. This was very useful because it gave us an overview of what should still be posted and when.</p>
		
<h3 class="subtitle">Things we didn’t expect</h3>
		<p>What we did not expect at the beginning of this project is that we would achieve our reach objective so easily. As already discussed, we had received the tip to use reels on instagram. We implemented this and had purposely chosen to add an existing sound under our reel. By means of these choices, we had already reached 4119 account after posting the 1st reel. As a result, by using Instagram, we achieved our reach objective 2 times with a result of reaching 5048 accounts.</p>
	  <p>We also found out that using hashtags on normal posts on instagram had only a minimal effect. By using hashtags, we reached about 10 more accounts. We expected this amount to be higher. Another thing we did not expect at the beginning of this project is that social media marketing on LinkedIn would be so difficult. LinkedIn turned out to be a very difficult platform to reach accounts with. We found out that using hashtags on LinkedIn had almost no effect on getting views and we also found out that you don't just get followed on LinkedIn like you did on Instagram. This made it very difficult for us to promote our brand on LinkedIn.</p>
	  
<h3 class="subtitle">What did we learn?</h3>
		<p>What we learned from this project is that on instagram it is fairly doable to reach a lot of people by using reels in combination with existing sounds. However, it is difficult to actually engage accounts and to interact with them. Also we learned that using hashtags was less help full than we thought.</p>
	  <p>We also learned that LinkedIn is not a platform to market on but more to find and make connections. Given the fact that we didn't have any connections yet, which made it very difficult for us to start this from scratch. That combined with the degree of difficulty of connecting with people who are on LinkenIn for a more serious purpose. Given that we were promoting a brand that is not actually going to be made, it was difficult to promote this on such a professional and serious platform and actually find people who are interested in our brand.</p>

<h3 class="subtitle">Was our strategy good/not good? Why?</h3>
		<p>We believe that our strategy by using Instagram has certainly been good. Given we have focused on engaging and empowering and uniting women. This is also exactly what our brand stood for. Given our success on instagram, we can reason that this strategy has definitely been good. It is just that our strategy of using LinkedIn has not been as successful. Given that it was not possible for us to reach the account on this platform that we had wanted to reach</p>
	  
      <h3 class="mt-4 Titlesegment">Future Planning</h3>
    <h5 class="titlefuture">Based on our experience, there are a few things we should keep doing, or change doing, if we were to continue with our brand.</h5>
<h3 class="subtitle">Keep doing:</h3>
      <p>Make more posts like the ‘president’ reel which was really successful in terms of views and interaction.</p>
      <p>Keep using a content calendar as we noticed this was very useful in combination with our busy schedules.</p>
	  <p>Keep using hashtags in posts, but try different ones or more per post. We had heard they were helpful but for us so far it didn’t look effective. We however believe this was our mistake, and should keep using this technique.</p>

<h3 class="subtitle">Change doing:</h3>
      <p>Find different ways on how to get more ‘actual’ comments, rather than comments by bots.</p>
      <p>Don’t use LinkedIn to create engagement and following, only use it to maintain the established customer relationships once the brand is known.</p>
	  <p>Find new platforms to create engagement and following as a starting brand. Looking back we believe we might have had to choose TikTok over LinkedIn for example.</p>
